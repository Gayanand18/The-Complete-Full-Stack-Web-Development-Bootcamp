            <p>Over the past century, women have made significant strides in politics, breaking barriers and challenging gender norms. From securing the right to vote to becoming world leaders, women have played an essential role in shaping political landscapes across the globe.</p>

            <p>One of the most important milestones was the suffrage movement, which began in the 19th century and culminated in the 20th century with women winning the right to vote in many countries. This right not only empowered women to participate in democratic processes but also inspired future generations to pursue political careers and leadership positions.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the number of women in positions of power has steadily increased. Female heads of state such as Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand and Angela Merkel of Germany have demonstrated the influence and capability of women in high political office. These leaders have not only impacted their countries' policies but also set an example for women everywhere to follow their ambitions in politics.</p>

            <p>Despite these advancements, women still face challenges in politics, including gender discrimination, unequal pay, and underrepresentation in many countries. However, movements like #MeToo and gender equality initiatives are helping to create a more inclusive political environment for women, making it easier for them to succeed and lead in politics.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, womenâ€™s roles in modern politics continue to evolve. While there are still hurdles to overcome, the progress made by women in the political arena demonstrates their vital contribution to shaping the future of society.</p>
