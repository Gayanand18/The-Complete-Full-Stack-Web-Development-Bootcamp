            <p>Social media has revolutionized communication, creating new opportunities for connection, expression, and self-promotion. However, for youth, its influence can be both positive and negative, as it significantly impacts their mental health, social skills, and personal development.</p>

            <p>On the positive side, social media offers youth a platform to express themselves, connect with peers globally, and engage with causes they care about. Many young people use social media to share creative work, participate in online communities, and become activists for social change.</p>

            <p>However, the pressures of social media can also lead to issues such as cyberbullying, self-esteem problems, and anxiety. Youth are particularly vulnerable to comparing themselves to unrealistic portrayals of beauty, success, and happiness on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. This can create feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, and depression.</p>

            <p>Moreover, excessive social media use can negatively affect face-to-face social skills, as young people become more comfortable with online interactions than in-person communication. This shift can lead to social isolation and difficulties in developing real-world relationships.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, social media has both positive and negative effects on youth. While it can foster creativity, connection, and activism, it is crucial to promote healthy social media habits and educate young people about managing their online presence responsibly.</p>
